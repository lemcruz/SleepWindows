# SleepWindows

A C program to bait Windows users and turnoff their PC.

# How it works

The program creates the folder C:/SleepWithTheFishes and add a file which contains a counter so you can know how many times the bait has been bitten.

# How to use

1. Compile the source code ( with gcc -dorme.c -o dorme ). 
2. Put the dorme.exe file in a hidden folder and then make a shortcut off of it to the desktop. 
3. Change the shortcut icon and rename it to an intriguing name (i.g. AdminPasswords). 

Whenever someone tries to open the shortcut the PC will turnoff and the bait counter will be increased by 1.

# Changes 

A version for linux may be added in the future.
